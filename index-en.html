        <h2>Finland Long Distance Skating Association</h2>
        <p>The Finland Long Distance Skating Association / Suomen Retkiluistelijat is a nationwide association for long-distance ice skating tours. Founded in 1992, the association has nearly 6,000 members throughout Finland, making it Finland's largest single-sport sports association.
</p><p>
The association organizes long-distance skating tours for its members every weekend during winter when ice conditions permit, and often on weekdays as well. The tours are led by experienced skaters who have received tour leader training.
</p><p>
The association also compiles and shares information about ice conditions on their member website for independent skating. We also provide training to our members for safe movement on ice.</p>

        <h2>What is Long Distance Skating?</h2>
        <p>Long distance skating involves traveling on natural ice, on the sea, lakes, along rivers, anywhere suitable ice can be found while respecting the limitations imposed by ice quality. The activity requires proper equipment, knowledge and skills. Long distance skating is typically done on guided tours, never alone. Long distance skating uniquely combines nature, exercise and togetherness.</p>
